# Abstract
Library for implementing the "Plateau Finding", a technique for trading systems optimization.

# Description
_plateau finding_ is a search & optimization technique whichs aproach is to look for "plain areas"
in a surface, in a search area that is generated by the outputs of a trading system, then, pick the highest 
of the points in the area (local optimum), this, in contrast with "hill climbing" algorithms, that 
looks for a "high peak" (global optimum). In a trading strategy context, is better to have several 
"neighbooring" configurations that produces "good and stable" results all of them, than, having one 
configuration with "the best" result but with neighbooring configurations producing "poor" results.
